FAQs
----

*Attempt counter doesn't match number of items available*
NPCs have a shared pool of items, so if another player has recently pickpocketed them, they will have less available.

*Vvardenfell NPCs*
Vvardenfell NPCs can allow four or more pickpocket attempts in certain circumstances. This is probably a bug and a very difficult one to accommodate, so any attempts outside the normal three are just marked as #3.
